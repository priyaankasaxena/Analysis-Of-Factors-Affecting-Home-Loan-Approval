## ANALYSIS OF FACTORS AFFECTING HOME LOAN APPROVAL

### Brief Summary on the Topic:

■ This set of tabulation relates to basic population and is based on full count. 

■ In these tables the total, male and female population on various levels of area units such as State, District, City and Urban Agglomeration and their decadal variation, the distribution of villages by population size, their population are presented. 

■	This is the basic population table of the 2011 Census which furnishes the population by sex for territorial units at different levels separately for rural and urban areas.

■	Besides population, this table also presents the area (in sq. kms.), density of population, number of inhabited villages and uninhabited villages, number of households for each of the territorial units namely India/State/Union Territory/District/UA/ City. 

■	The area figures for States/Union Territories and Districts are as computed by Surveyor General of India and at lower levels below Districts the area figures are as supplied by the State Directors of Land Records or other local authorities.

■	These tabulations are compiled from the population count of the smallest units, the enumeration block. 

### Description of analysis procedure and objectives:

I have tried to done Descriptive analytics which usually aims at developing population based ratio /rates with this data set. Originally this data set were having sample of 19992 US observations and 15 variables in the data set but then I have removed unnecessary columns from the data by sub setting the data set after which I have left with 676 observation with 11 variables. Data had NA columns and might had duplicates, so, some commands ( as mentioned in coding)were used to clean data for the analysis.

#### Objectives-

■	Find data related to Number of Villages, Towns, Households, Population and Area.

■	Data cleaning.

■	Determine State wise Sex Ratio( Male: Female) amongst Total Population.

■	Determine areas with High Male to Female Ratio in order to indirectly identify potential pockets of Female foeticide.

■	Determine no. of Households, Area available to States and thus determine highly and sparsely populated states in India.
